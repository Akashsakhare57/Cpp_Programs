#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  int num=70;
  if( num < 100 ){
     cout<<"number is less than 100";
  }

  if(num > 100){
     cout<<"number is greater than 100";
  }
  return 0;
}


and there is a Nested if>>>
  if( num < 100 ){
      cout<<"number is less than 100"<<endl;
      if(num > 50){
         cout<<"number is greater than 50";
