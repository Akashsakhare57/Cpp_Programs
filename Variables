Global Variable >>>

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
// This is a global variable
char myVar = 'A';
int main()
{
   cout <<"Value of myVar: "<< myVar<<endl;
   myVar='Z';
   cout <<"Value of myVar: "<< myVar;
   return 0;
}

>>> Output:

Value of myVar: A
Value of myVar: Z

//global variables declared outside of main and We have accessed the variable twice in the main() function without any issues.

Local Variable >>>

Local variables are declared inside the braces of any user defined function, main function, loops or
any control statements(if, if-else etc) and have their scope limited inside those braces.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

char myFuncn() {
// This is a local variable
char myVar = 'A';
}
int main()
{
   cout <<"Value of myVar: "<< myVar<<endl;
   myVar='Z';
   cout <<"Value of myVar: "<< myVar;
   return 0;
}

>>>Compile time error, because we are trying to access the variable myVar outside of its scope.
The scope of myVar is limited to the body of function myFuncn(), inside those braces.
